# Configuration Guide

The config file must be at `js/config.json` in your project root.

## `app` - Your PlayerAI Implementation

```json
"app": {
  "player_ai_module": "my_player",
  "player_ai_class": "MyPlayerAI"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `player_ai_module` | Python module name (filename without `.py`). If your file is `my_player.py`, use `"my_player"`. Must be importable from the directory where you run `q21-player`. |
| `player_ai_class` | Class name inside that module. Must inherit from `PlayerAI`. |

|-------|-------------|
| `account` | Your Gmail address that will send/receive game messages. |

**Setup:**

2. Create a project → Enable Gmail API
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app)
4. Download JSON → Save as `credentials.json` in your project folder

| `display_name` | Your name as shown in the game. Can include spaces. |

## Alternative: Environment Variables

You can also use a `.env` file instead of (or in addition to) `config.json`:

```bash
# .env
GMAIL_ACCOUNT=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./credentials.json
GMAIL_TOKEN_PATH=./token.json

GTAI_DB_HOST=localhost
GTAI_DB_PORT=5432
GTAI_DB_NAME=q21_player
GTAI_DB_USER=postgres
GTAI_DB_PASSWORD=your-password
```

Environment variables are loaded first, then `js/config.json` values override them.
