This package provides the RLGM (Referee-League Game Manager) and
GMC (Game Manager Component) for handling league and game communication.

Main entry point:
    MessageRouter - routes all protocol messages to appropriate handlers

Components:
    RLGMController - handles league-level communication
    GMController - handles individual game execution
    GPRM - game parameters for game execution
    GameResult - result of game execution
    DemoAI - demo PlayerAI for testing without LLM
