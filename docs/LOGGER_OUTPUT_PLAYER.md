# Logger Output PRD - Player Perspective

**Version:** 1.4
**Status:** CANONICAL REFERENCE
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-11

---

## 1. Overview

This document specifies the logger output format for the **Player** agent. The logger should only output protocol-related messages (sent/received emails) and callback function invocations. All standard [INFO] level logs should be suppressed.

---

## 2. Display Rules

| Log Type | Color | When to Display |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Protocol Messages | **Green** | When sending or receiving protocol emails |
| Callback Functions | **Orange** | When invoking or receiving response from callbacks |
| Errors | **Red** | When an error occurs |

**Suppressed:** All [INFO] level logs - only protocol send/receive and callbacks are shown.

---

## 3. Protocol Message Log Format

### 3.1 Format Specification

```
HH:MM:SS | GAME-ID: SSRRGGG | SENT/RECEIVED | to/from {email} | MESSAGE-NAME | EXPECTED-RESPONSE: {next} | ROLE: {role} | DEADLINE: HH:MM:SS
```

### 3.2 Field Definitions

| Field | Label | Format | Description |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| F1 | *(none)* | `HH:MM:SS` | Time (Hour:Minute:Seconds) |
| F2 | `GAME-ID:` | `SSRRGGG` | Game ID (SS=Season, RR=Round, GGG=Game). Normalized to 7-digit format. |
| F3 | *(none)* | `SENT` or `RECEIVED` | Direction of email |
| F4 | `to` or `from` | `{email address}` | Email address with direction prefix |
| F5 | *(none)* | Message name | Simplified name from lookup table |
| F6 | `EXPECTED-RESPONSE:` | Next message | Next message per protocol flow |
| F7 | `ROLE:` | Role status | `PLAYER-ACTIVE` or `PLAYER-INACTIVE` |
| F8 | `DEADLINE:` | `HH:MM:SS` | Deadline for next message |

### 3.3 Role Determination (F7)

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| `PLAYER-ACTIVE` | Player is participating in the current game/round |
| `PLAYER-INACTIVE` | Player is NOT participating in the current game/round |

**Rule:** Q21 messages (game-level) always imply `PLAYER-ACTIVE`. The referee only sends Q21 messages to participating players. The `PLAYER-INACTIVE` status only applies to round-level `START-ROUND` messages when the player has no assignments for that round. For season-level messages (e.g., `START-SEASON`, `SIGNUP-RESPONSE`), the role field is empty (prints `ROLE:` with no value).

### 3.4 Game ID Normalization (F2)

The game_id must always be displayed in 7-digit `SSRRGGG` format. Non-standard formats are normalized:

| Input Format | Output | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Standard 7-digit | Pass through | `0102001` → `0102001` |
| Training format | Extract trailing 7 digits | `TRAIN_2026-02-11_0900_0102001` → `0102001` |
| Other with trailing digits | Extract trailing 7 digits | `PREFIX_0103002` → `0103002` |

**Implementation:** The `set_game_context()` method in `protocol_logger.py` stores the game_id directly. Callers are responsible for passing a 7-digit normalized ID.
